This is a web application built using React and Django that provides compression services for various file formats. The application allows users to upload files and compress them to reduce their size, making it easier to share, and transfer files.

## Files

- **Presets and Customization**: It offers a range of compression presets tailored to specific platforms and use cases. From social media platforms to website optimization, choose the appropriate preset to achieve optimal results effortlessly.

- **Secure and Private:** The application is secure and private. It uses SSL encryption to protect data and files. It also deletes files from the server after compression to ensure privacy.
